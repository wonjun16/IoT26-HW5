# IoT26-HW05 - Home Assistant on Raspberry Pi

## 1. Objective

This assignment is to set up Home Assistant on Raspberry Pi and control LEDs using GPIO pins.

## 2. Hardware

- Raspberry Pi
- Breadboard
- 2 LEDs
- 2 resistors
- Jumper wires
- PC or laptop

## 3. Software

- Home Assistant OS
- Samba share add-on
- rpi_gpio custom integration

## 4. Setup Process

Home Assistant OS was installed on Raspberry Pi.  
After the initial setup, I accessed Home Assistant through a web browser and created a user account.

Samba share was installed to access the `configuration.yaml` file from Windows.

### 4.2 Samba Share Setup

The Samba share add-on was installed to access the Home Assistant configuration files from Windows.

Using Samba share, I accessed the `config` folder from my PC and edited the `configuration.yaml` file.

## 5. rpi_gpio Setup

The original tutorial used the `rpi_gpio` integration, but the current Home Assistant version did not support it by default.

So I installed the `ha-rpi_gpio` custom integration and copied the `rpi_gpio` folder to:

`/config/custom_components/rpi_gpio`

## 6. configuration.yaml

The following code was added to `configuration.yaml`.

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: rpi_gpio
    switches:
      - port: 11
        name: "Fan Office"
      - port: 12
        name: "Light Desk"

```
